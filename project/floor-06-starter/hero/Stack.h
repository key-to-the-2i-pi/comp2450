// COMP 2450 — Floor 6 starter
// hero/Stack.h — LIFO stack template. THE WORK IS HERE.
//
// One header, four one-line method bodies you write, one day:
//   Monday — push, pop, size, empty.  (top() ships written; see below.)
//
// This week's lesson, on one slide: a stack is NOT a data structure.
// It is an *ADT* — a contract that says "the last thing pushed is the
// next thing returned." Many data structures can implement that
// contract. We pick one (your Floor-4½ Chain<T>) and we ADAPT it —
// five trivial delegates is the entire implementation.
//
// `std::stack<T>` is exactly this pattern: by default it adapts
// `std::deque<T>`. We're recreating the standard library's own move.
//
//
// =====================================================================
// Why a Chain<T> and not a Bag<T>?
// =====================================================================
// Either would WORK (both have push_back / pop_back). The Chain<T>
// choice is deliberate because Chain<T>::push_front and pop_front are
// both O(1), and our Stack<T>'s top will be the *front* of the chain.
// On a Bag<T> (which wraps std::vector), pop_back is O(1) but
// pop_front would be O(n). Choosing the right underlying container is
// the entire point of an adapter; we want O(1) push and pop on both
// ends, but specifically on the SAME end. front-of-Chain wins.
//
// =====================================================================
// Why the bodies are TODOs even though they are one line each.
// =====================================================================
// Brevity IS the lesson. These trivial bodies look like nothing, but
// the choice you make — which Chain operation maps to which Stack
// operation — determines whether your Stack is actually LIFO. If you
// pick push_back here and pop_front for pop(), you have built a queue
// instead. Reading the test failures is how you find out.
